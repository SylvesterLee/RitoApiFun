# RitoApiFun


Using a Riot API key, a summoner name and a server(in Main.py), calculates the cooldown of every player's summoner spells. 

Buttons can be clicked to start a countdown that shows when the summoner spells is available again. 

If a player buys Boots of Lucidity, it manually needs to be checked off.
If a player has Teleport, the level of the player has to manually be set.
